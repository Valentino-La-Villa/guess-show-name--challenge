# React + Vite

The assignment and rules are as follows:

```
> The goal of the game is to guess a TV show's name.
> The player will see a placeholder for a TV name with some missing letters. The player should guess and fill in the TV show's name. If the player guesses succesfully, it gets a point and moves forward to guess another tv show name
> The player would be able to use a hint feature in case they're stuck with a specific TV show.
> The player has a total of 3 lives. For each wrong guess, it loses a life. If the player los all 3 lives the game is over and can be started again.
> The player would be able to view their high score.

API to use: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/tv/get-top-rated-tv

The main page should contain:

> Generated TV name with missing letters to fill.
> An input component, where the player can enter their guess.
> 'Check the guess' button.
> 'Hint' button.
> 'Statistics button' (replaced in the project by a straight high score display instead of a popup).
